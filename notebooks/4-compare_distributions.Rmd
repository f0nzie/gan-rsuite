## Introduction

**Objective**
Compare the training distribution against the distribution that was generated by the GAN.


**Steps** \
1. Get the code that generates the training data (distribution) \
2. How different is the original training data from the deformed distribution? \
3. What number of epochs needs to be run to resemble the original training data? \
4. How much disturbance is added by the generator sampler (uniform distrobution)?
