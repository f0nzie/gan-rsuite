title: "Call PyTorch GAN module from R"
output: html_notebook
---

**Purpose**
Run the GAN faster by executing directly the PyTorch code.

**Observations**
1. There is no difference in execution time in calling the Python module from R notebook or
executing it from PyCharm.
2. Importing a function that calls numpy erases the seeds in the GAN. Fix: Call the function `fivenum` before numpy for GAN

**Findings**
The problem with this approach is that the printing occurs at the end of the process because Python cannot print in real time from Rmarkdown, but it is as fast as Python.

## Generating one sample

```{r}
library(rTorch)
library(tictoc)
```



```{python}
# Generate only one sample from training. No external loop.
import time
t = time.time()

from gan_torch import train  # this script is under notebooks. same folder.

ret_values = train()
elapsed = time.time() - t
print("Elapsed time (s)\n", elapsed)
```

```{python}
from py_functions import fivenum

fivenum(ret_values)
```

```

> Observations
1. Taking one sample will give most likely a skewed distribution.
2. The `fivenum` of one sample will be different than the fivenum of a greater number of samples.
3. The returned values from a GAN with a seed will be repeatable if the process followed during the execution is exactly the same. For instance, if the notebook is restarted when generating a sample, for the next sample to be the same, the notebook will have to be restarted as well.
