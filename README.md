The original number of epochs is `5,000`.
Originally there is no seed to "control"" the randomness.


## Observations
* The maximum number of iterations tried is `10`; the minimum in `1`.
Each iteration produces a new distribution sample.

* We can say that definitely is not a good idea to go through epochs lower than 1000 because they start presenting bimodalism. A minimum acceptable number of epochs seems to be 1250-1350.
