## Dependencies

* Python package `tensorboardX`
* Local script `utils.py`
* Not necessary to create folders for data or output. If data not available it will download from site.

## Observations

* Running it from the notebook shows the progression of images as the algorithm iterate through epochs and batches.
* Running the script does not show images in real time. The images are saved automatically in the folder `data`.
